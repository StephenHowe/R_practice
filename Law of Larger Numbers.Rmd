This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# print start time of experiment
Sys.time()

# set number of tosses and the interval for plotting
tosses <- 1000000
intseq <- 100

# create a random number between 0 and 1 for each toss
randnum <- runif(1:tosses)

# bucket each random number into either heads or tail. 1 = tails
outcomes <- ifelse(randnum > 0.5, 1, 0)

# print the outcomes
# outcomes

#find the empirical probability for our trial and print result
#empprob <- sum(outcomes)/tosses
empprob <- mean(outcomes)
empprob

#cumulatively sum all th outcomes
c.outcomes <- cumsum(outcomes)

#create sequence of intervals to be used for plotting and capture the values of the 
#cumulative outcomes at each of those intervals
plot.bucket <- seq(from = 10, to = tosses, by = intseq)
#plot.bucket <- log(seq(from = 10, to = tosses, by = intseq),10)
plot.bucket.data <- c.outcomes[plot.bucket]/plot.bucket

#plot coin toss results against intervals
plot(plot.bucket, plot.bucket.data, type = "l", log="x", col="blue", ann = FALSE)
title(main = "Empirical Probability of Random Coin Toss", xlab = "Number of Tosses", ylab = "Cumulative Probability")
#draw horizontal line at .50 for theoretical probability
abline(a = 0.5, b = 0, col = "red")

Sys.time()

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
