This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. Within this file is running commentary on my practice of Text Mining with R. At the same time, I am putting my notes and exercies in RNotebook as a means to learn RNotebook.

# Overview
This chapter covers relationships between works using n-grams. In this chapter we learn about two new packages, ggraph and widyr. ggraph extends ggplot2 to build network plots. widyr calculates distances between pairs within a tidy dataframe.

First, let's load the required libraries. If these libraries have not previously installed, uncomment the first lines of the codeblock to install them.

```{r}
# install.packages("dplyr")
# install.packages("tidytext")
# install.packages("janeaustenr")

library(dplyr)
library(tidytext)
library(janeaustenr)

# The code below tokenizes the works of Jane Austen into n-gram pairs
austen_bigrams <- austen_books() %>%
  unnest_tokens(bigram, text, token = "ngrams", n = 2)

austen_bigrams
```

Now, let's look at what we have.
```{r}
austen_bigrams %>%
  count(bigram, sort = TRUE)
```

There are a lot of stop words here that detract from seeing meaningful relationships. We can use the following code to first separate our bi-grams into two columns, using the separate() function, and then remove any pairs of words where either one of the wors ar stop words.

```{r}
library(tidyr)

bigrams_separated <- austen_bigrams %>%
  separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ")

bigrams_filtered <- bigrams_separated %>%
  filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word) %>%
  filter(!word2 %in% stop_words$word)

# new bigram counts:
bigram_counts <- bigrams_filtered %>% 
  count(word1, word2, sort = TRUE)

bigram_counts
```

We can also do the same thing with trigrams. In this code example, we tokenize the works of Jane Austen into trigrams, separate those trigrams into three columns of words, filter those words against the stop word list, and then count our remaining trigram.

```{r}
austen_books() %>%
  unnest_tokens(trigram, text, token = "ngrams", n = 3) %>%
  separate(trigram, c("word1", "word2", "word3"), sep = " ") %>%
  filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word,
         !word2 %in% stop_words$word,
         !word3 %in% stop_words$word) %>%
  count(word1, word2, word3, sort = TRUE)
```

What are the most common streets mentioned in Jane Austen? In this part, we use our previously created list of bigrams, separated and filtered against the stopword list, and then filtered again for pairs of words where the second word is 'street'.

```{r}
bigrams_filtered %>%
  filter(word2 == "street") %>%
  count(book, word1, sort = TRUE)
```

```{r}
bigrams_united <- bigrams_filtered %>%
  unite(bigram, word1, word2, sep = " ")

bigram_tf_idf <- bigrams_united %>%
  count(book, bigram) %>%
  bind_tf_idf(bigram, book, n) %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf))

bigram_tf_idf

library(ggplot2)

bigram_tf_idf %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %>%
  mutate(bigram = factor(bigram, levels = rev(unique(bigram)))) %>% group_by(book) %>%
  top_n(15) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  ggplot(aes(bigram, tf_idf, fill = book)) + geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "tf-idf") +
  facet_wrap(~book, ncol = 2, scales = "free") + coord_flip()
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
